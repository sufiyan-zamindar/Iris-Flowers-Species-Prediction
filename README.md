# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flowers Species Prediction

This project predicts the species of Iris flowers using a machine learning classifier.

---

It is built with **scikit-learn** and can be deployed with **Streamlit** to make predictions interactively.

---

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**

- **Objective:** Classify an Iris flower into one of three species (*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica*) based on flower measurements.
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier for robust and accurate prediction.
- **Visualization:** Includes a decision boundary plot to show how features separate classes.

---

## ðŸ“Š **Dataset**

- Source: **Iris Dataset** (built-in with `scikit-learn`)
- Features:
  - Sepal length (cm)
  - Sepal width (cm)
  - Petal length (cm)
  - Petal width (cm)
- Target: Iris species (`Setosa`, `Versicolor`, `Virginica`)
